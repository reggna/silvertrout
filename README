What is SilverTrout?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SilverTrout is a IRC bot written in java published under GNU General Public 
License (read the state above). 

This package contains all basic functionalities and an extensive potential 
with its easy implemented plugin system. It also contains some prearranged 
plugins with the most common functionalities.


To build SilverTrout from source code:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SilverTrout and its plugins are written in Java 6.0 you will need the 
Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile the source code. The latest version of 
JDK may be found at Sun Microsystem’s web page: 
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

To use the build system you need to have ANT intalled. The latest version of 
ANT may be found at the Apache Ant's  web page:
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

When you have installed JDK and ensured that your PATH variable is correctly 
configured run the build script using ant:

  ant build


Configure SilverTrout:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Start SilverTrout by executing the command:

  ant run

The first time SilverTrout is executed it will create a template configuration
file called config.xml and by changing this file you may customize SilverTrout 
to work as you want it to.

The xml configuration file should only contain xml elements and attributes. By 
looking in the template file you’ll get the grip on how the file should be 
formatted.


Configure plugins:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some plugins have extended configuration abilities and may take input from the 
configuration file. Examples:

 <plugin name="XDCCServer">
  <folder>C:\Documents and Settings\Greger\name\Skrivbord\folder</folder>
  <slots>3</slots>
 </plugin>
 <plugin name="Quizmaster">
  <channel>#quizchannel</channel>
 </plugin> 
 <plugin name="AdminBoy">
  <password>mypassword</password>
 </plugin>

NOTE: If you store your config in resources/config.xml it will be copied to 
the correct place and used everytime you run silvertrout. Your copy in 
build/classes/config.xml will be removed each time you do 'ant clean' or 
overwritten if there is a newer config.xml file in resources folder.

Start SilverTrout:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting SilverTrout works the same way in every system with java capabilities. 
Simply run the following command in the base directory:
  
  run ant
